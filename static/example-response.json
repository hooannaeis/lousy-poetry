What the hell  are you doing in a church?\nI will tell you what the hell I am doing in a church.\nBasically, I am kinda\nGenerally triyna\nignore\nThat the setting\nIs the wedding\nOf\nThe Love of my Life. \nWhich would be quite nice\nIf i were to marry the bride.\nBut I am not.\nInstead \nI stand here, \nDoing..what I cannot.\nI am singing.\nBut more so I am thinking.\nHow I could lose the fight\nFor said love of my life.\nI am smart, if not brillant.\nI am fast yet diligent.\nI look good, if not great.\n\nThe cookbook Is my mate\nI repair better than a janitor\nI write letters to the editor\nI love sports as well as chores.\nI earn more than any of my friends.\n\u0026 when I am drunk I even can dance.\n\nLet alone my skills in the bed.\nBasically all my last women said\nThat they consider it the greatest luck\nThat it was me who gave them their latest…kiss on the cheek.\n\nNow, me being all so modest\nI don't see how one could protest.\nI think pretty much\nshe should hit me up.\nAnd not the guy she is now about to marry.\nI want to shout so madly:\nDon't do it!\nDon't do it!\nHe is an idiot.\nI should be the one to stand\nNext to her holding her hand.\nPutting the ring on her finger.\nNot the one worrying about\nHow i am such a bad of a singer.\nWe could be ultimate lovers.\n\nShe's the a to my o\nShe's the answer to my echo\nShe's the punch to my lines\nShe's the puns to my rhymes.\nShe's the bridge to my abyss.\n\nBut more than all of this\nShe should not. become his.\nOh, how much i wish\nThat when he asks \nShe would decline\nBecause then she could be mine.\n\nBut now she never will\nFind out that I love her still.\nNow our Love will be one-sided forever\nFor I never dared to actually tell her.\n\n\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\n\n\n[HAPPY END - PART II]\n\t- If any person here can show cause why these two people should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace.\nAnd if this sentence is said by the priest\nEveryone knows\nThat it's the christian code\nFor \"shut the fuck up\". Please.\n\n\t- Speak now or forever hold your peace.\nBut Oh my god!\nNo, I should not \nshut the fuck up, please!\nThe chance is mine to seize.\n\nSo I hold my breath\nAnd noticed that\nThe bride's family\nAlready stared at me\nAs i Looked up,\nThen stood up\nand screamed:\n\t- Don't do it!\n\tDon't do it!\n\tHe's an idiot!\n\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaand\nNow EVERYBODY was staring at me.\n\n\t- Errr…is it too late to say\n\tThat I made the statement,\n\tHoping no one would take the shot?\n\t\nMentioned the hooded mate of God\n\n\tIn all the years I practiced\n\tThere never was none who acted\n\tAfter I had said this.\n\n\t- \"Excuse me?\"\nSaid the groom.\nmaybe aware of his imminent doom.\n\n\t- You heard me,\nI muttered.\n\t- I am an idiot?\nThe groom uttered.\n\n\t- He..he..is an idiot?\nThe bride stuttered.\n\n\t- Yes, no, I don't know.\n\tThat's not my point,\n\tBut rather \n\tthat you two should not be joined\n\tIn holy Matrimony.\n\tPlease bride (I had forgotten her name)\n\tYou are the love of my life.\n\tIf you marry him now\n\tIf you give him your vow.\n\tMy suffering\n\tWould be forever.\n\tSay, do you think\n\tWe could be together?\n\t\n\t- \"who the hell are you?\",\nThe groom again.\n\t- \"I am the one who wishes you to take a broom and then...\"\n\n\t- \"that's not what I asked for\n\tAre you part of the\n\tFun-at-the-wedding-taskforce?\n\tIf so, i think you don't know what fun is.\"\n\n\t- Well, in that case my name is Hannes.\n\tBut could you stop your riot\n\tAnd please be quiet.\n\tI am trying to make  a declaration of Love\n\tAnd youre disturbing My preparation a lot.\"\n\nSo, a step forward to the bride I did\nNot too close, to avoid the groom's fist\nNot too far, to not miss the bride's whiff.\n\n\t- \"oh you.\"\nSaid the bride\nAs she forgot my name too.\n\n\t- \"Yes, me.\n\tOh and\n\tI know, I might have destroyed your moment,\n\tSo I would like to apologize.\n\tI had to do it because otherwise\n\tI would regret it all my Life. \n\tAnd my happiness could never be restored\n\tBut believe me\n\twhen you are bored,\n\tI will  be your fun.\n\tWhen you're cold\n\tI will be your sun.\n\tI can turn old\n\tI can play young.\n\tI can stay bold\n\tWhen others would run.\n\tIf you want help from above\n\tI will be the nun.\n\tIf you search for Love\n\tI shall be the one.\n\tSo finally as the last but not least thing\n\tI even got us two these rings.\n\tAnd although I know \n\tThey look very cheap,\n\tWould you please just marry me?\n\n\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\n[FANCY END - PART III]\n\n\n\t- Holy shit!\n\tDo you mean all of this?\n\tDo you actually ask my bride\n\tWho is just about to become my wife\n\tTo marry you?\n\n\t- Yes Sit, very true\n\tThat's exactly what I do.\n\tI saw the chance \u0026 had to seize it\n\tSorry, if it's hard for you to believe this\n\tBut technically the priest is\n\tAt fault. \n\tHe asked if we'd like this wedding\n\tTo come to a halt.\n\tWe should speak now of forever hold our piece.\n\tAnd speak now I did.\n\tHow am I to blame if he's too shortsighted\n\tToo naive to see this coming?\n\tI know It's all very stunning.\n\tBut I only expressed my feelings\n\tAnd where if not under these ceilings\n\tShould this be allowed?\"\n\n\t- \"well I am sorry. \n\tWhoever is to blame.\n\tWhatever damn game you're playing.\n\tI can no longer let you desire\n\tThis woman you apparently admire.\n\tLeave now or I'll set you on fire.\"\n\n\t- On fire I already am.\n\tBut if this Is your wish\n\tThen leave, I can.\n\tAfter all I'm a civilized man\n\tIf you will, allow me some last words\n\tThey won't make this any worse.\n\tBride (I still don't remember her name)\n\tJust so you know\n\tAll this was not a show\n\tYou are this one woman\n\tFor which I would \n\tNot only write one poem.\n\tBut hundreds, thousands, millions.\n\tOkay maybe that's exaggerated.\n\tHowever, don't be exasperated\n\tIf I rained on your parade.\n\tNow, leave I shall\n\tTo prove that I only mean well.\n\nSo I walked out of the church slowly\nArgonized by one thought only.\nI might forever stay lonely.\nBecause of this stupid holy\nMatrimony.\n\nI got out of the chruch and into my Volvo\nPondering what I just had gone through.\n\nAnd when I was just about to ride away,\nSuddenly the church opened its iron gates\nThrough which the bride then chased\nRight towards my car.\nJumped in.\nScreamed\n\n\t- \"quick, quick!!\n\tI did it,\n\tI admit it\n\tHe IS an idiot. \n\tQuick! Let's go!\"\n\nAnd That was sth\nI was not prepared for.\nTo say the least.\nTherefore it was my inner beast\nwho would stay bold\nAnd took control.\nHit the gas pedal\nAs if to win \nsome racing-class medal.\nWhen my Volvo took off.\nits new tires were squealing\nPast the entire herd leaving\nThe curch, following us.\nThey had the desire by screaming\nTo Make us two stop.\nBut it was too late.\nWe had escaped.\n\nI was so happy\nI could not stop to smile\nThus I only asked after quite a while:\n\n\t- Hey bride,\n\tWhat's your name again?\n\t\nInstead of answering she would just take my hand\nLook at me with her eyes\nAnd had me a bit surprised\nWhen she said\n\n\t- I love you\n\nWell, ain't this nice.\nFor then I had her\nA bit surprised\nWhen I said\n\n\t- I love you\n\tIs my name, too.\n",
